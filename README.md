  ## Description
 
  Welcome to RepMaster! 
  
  An online work out app where you can keep track of your workouts! To use simply make an account and build workouts, fill them with exercises, and assign them to days of the week. Once assigned you will be able to check which workout is scheduled for the day. Additionally, you can edit the weight, number of sets, and number of reps for each exercise!

  For easy access, this web app can be downloaded as a progressive web application onto your computer or mobile device!

  Happy Lifting!

  ## Usage
  
Once your account has been created you can create new workouts by selecting the workouts tab on the navigation bar at the top of your screen. Once a workout has been created exercises can be added to it using the add exercise form below the workout title. To toggle between different workouts the drop menu labled selected workout can be used.

Once you have built a workout it can be assigned to a day of the week on the Calender tab using drop down menus.

Once assigned to a day of the week, the Today page will display all exercises that are contained in the workout assigned to the current day. Additionally, the weight assigned to an exercise can be incremented by using the plus button next to said workout.

The My Page tab is used if you need to update your password. If you ever forget your current password you can select forgot password on the login page to have a temporary password emailed to you. Once you have this password make sure that you change it using the my page to something more secure and easy to remember!
